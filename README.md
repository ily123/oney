	- **SQLAlchemy** for object mapping
	- **Alembic** for easy migration management
- Back-end API (Python)
	- **Flask** with assorted libraries such as **WTForms**
	- Served with **gunicorn** from a **Docker** container
- Front-end client (JavaScript)
	- UI is written in **React** using functional components
	- **Redux** state management

## Code snippet
```
import './ProductCard.css'
import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

const ProductCard = ({id,price,images,title}) => {
	let image = images[0]?.url_570xN
	if (image) {
		return (
			<div className="prod">
				<NavLink to={`/products/${id}`}>
					<div className='product_card'>
					<img className= 'productImage' src={image} alt="Product Photo"/>
					<span className='productTitle'>{title}</span>
					<span className='productPrice'>${price}</span>
					</div>
				</NavLink>
			</div>
		);
	}
	return null
};
